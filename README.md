## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Mobile-first design

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new but it's nice to get some repetition in with foundational skills so I can comfortably move on to more complicated topics!

### Continued development

Flexbox is such a nice thing that I'll definitely keep using as I move forward with other challenges/projects!
